title: ChatPRD - Feature Implementation Spec
description: A single-feature spec optimized for handing to an AI coding agent. Defines exactly what to build, acceptance criteria, edge cases, and files to touch — everything needed for a focused implementation session.
instructions: Write this as a tight, actionable spec for one feature that an AI coding assistant can execute in a single session. Be extremely specific about acceptance criteria — each one should be independently testable. The technical approach should name exact files, functions, and components to create or modify. Edge cases should cover error states, empty states, loading states, and permission boundaries. Skip philosophy and context-setting — go straight to what needs to be built.

# ChatPRD: Feature Implementation Spec

## Section 1 – Feature Summary

What this feature does in 1-2 sentences, why it matters, and who uses it.

### Scope

- **In scope**: What is part of this feature
- **Out of scope**: What is explicitly NOT included
- **Prerequisites**: Features or infrastructure that must exist first
- **Depends on**: APIs, data, or services this feature needs

## Section 2 -Acceptance Criteria

Numbered list of specific, testable criteria. Each should be independently verifiable.

### Must-Have (P0)

1. User can [action] and sees [result]
2. System [validates/enforces] [rule]
3. [State change] persists after page refresh

### Should-Have (P1)

4. [Secondary capability]
5. [Edge case handling]

### Nice-to-Have (P2)

6. [Polish item]

Each criterion should be a concrete behavior, not a vague quality ('User can filter by date range and sees results update within 500ms' not 'Filtering works well').

## Section 3 - User Flow

Step-by-step walkthrough of the user interaction.

### Happy Path

1. **Entry point**: User navigates to [page] and sees [initial state]
2. **Action**: User clicks [element] / fills [form] / selects [option]
3. **Feedback**: System shows [loading state / optimistic update]
4. **Result**: User sees [success state / new content / confirmation]
5. **Next step**: User can now [follow-up action]

### Alternate Paths

- **Path B**: If user [alternative action], then [what happens]
- **Path C**: If user [cancels/goes back], then [what happens]

Note specific UI components and layout at each step.

## Section 4Edge Cases & Error States

Everything that could go wrong or deviate from the happy path.

### Input Validation

- Empty/missing required fields → [error message]
- Invalid format (email, URL, etc.) → [error message]
- Input too long/short → [error message]

### System Errors

- Network failure → [retry behavior, offline message]
- Server error (500) → [error UI, retry option]
- Timeout → [timeout message, recovery]

### Permission & State

- Unauthorized access → [redirect, error message]
- Stale data / concurrent edit → [conflict resolution]
- Empty state (no data yet) → [empty state UI, CTA]
- Rate limited → [throttle message]

## Section 5 - Technical Approach

Implementation strategy — specific enough to build from, but not actual code.

### Files to Create/Modify

- `src/components/[Feature]/` — New component(s)
- `src/app/api/[route]/` — New or modified API endpoint
- `src/lib/[module].ts` — Business logic
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Schema changes (if any)

### Data Flow

1. UI triggers [action]
2. Calls [API endpoint / server action]
3. Validates input with [schema]
4. Reads/writes [database table]
5. Returns [response shape]
6. UI updates [state / cache]

### New Dependencies

List any new packages needed with justification.

## Section 6 -

Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies

- **Upstream**: APIs or features this depends on
- **Downstream**: What depends on this feature
- **External**: Third-party services required

### Technical Risks

- **Performance**: Will this be slow at scale? What is the expected query volume?
- **Security**: Any new attack surface (user input, file upload, etc.)?
- **Data integrity**: Risk of data corruption or loss?

### Rollout Strategy

- **Feature flag**: Is one needed?
- **Staged rollout**: Internal → beta → GA?
- **Rollback plan**: How to revert if something goes wrong

## Section 7 - Test Plan

### Manual Testing

Step-by-step QA checklist:

1. [Test the happy path end to end]
2. [Test each edge case from above]
3. [Test on mobile / different browsers if relevant]

### Automated Tests

- **Unit tests**: Business logic, validation, utilities
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints with database
- **E2E tests**: Critical user flow (if warranted)

### Regression Checks

- Verify [related feature A] still works
- Verify [related feature B] still works
- Check error tracking (Sentry) for new errors after deploy
